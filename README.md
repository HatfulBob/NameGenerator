# NameGenerator
Generates a large list of names with nicknames.

An old project dating back to October 2016, a simple program that generates a large text file of names in the format '"Nickname" Name)
Forces alliteration.

This project includes a text file full of names, adjectives (for nicknames), food and a merged list of the names and food, so you can replace any of the parameters to generate names such as "Zucchini" Zack.
