# NameGenerator
Generates a large list of names with nicknames.

An old project dating back to October 2016, a simple program that generates a large text file of names in the format '"Nickname" Name)
Forces alliteration.

This project includes a text file full of names, adjectives (for nicknames), food and a merged list of the names and food, so you can replace any of the parameters to generate names such as "Zucchini" Zack. 

Unfortunately, this program was created so long ago that I have no idea where I had found the text documents of names, foods and adjectives, so I am unable to give credit to those sources at the moment. I believe you can find them again through a very quick Google search but I forgot where the names are from, all I know is that I did not create the text files myself and enter every single name/food I knew.

## Features
* Generates a large list of names that can be pulled from at random
* Optionally generate names with nicknames (with each nickname having the same first letter as the name)
* Full control over name/nickname lists so you can replace them with different text files just be replacing files/changing what text file is loaded
* A method to return a number of randomly generated names (functionality to prevent getting the same names repeated TBA)
